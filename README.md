# Bike Lock Cracker

This project is created to help open letter-based bike locks with unknown, English word combinations.

These locks are most often 4-letter words with each changeable dial having 10 possible letters. This means that there are a total of 10<sup>4</sup> (10,000) raw combinations. This project aims to lower that amount by giving only the combinations that are English words (often what the manufacturers set them to to improve combination recollection).

From experience, 85%-93% of combinations can be eliminated (4-dial, 10-letter) depending on the set of English words that it is checked against and the letters used on each dial. The user can choose between a "normal" set of English words (default) and an extremely verbose set of English words. 

The words will also be displayed in an order that can easily be cycled through on the bike lock, rotating the rightmost dial first and leftmost dial last.

This process can be time intensive, but I've used it successfully before.

# Instructions
1. Click [here](https://andjf.github.io/BikeLockPicker)
2. Enter the letters on each dial into separate text inputs
3. Add or remove inputs as needed
4. When finished, press the "Check" button and wait for words to show
5. You can cycle through the words with the on-screen arrow buttons
6. You can navigate to a certain word by either entering a number or a word in the search field and selecting "Search"

If you've come back to the cracking later and have remembered what word/number you are currently on, make sure to input the letters in the same order as the first time you cycled through. Otherwise, the order might be different.
